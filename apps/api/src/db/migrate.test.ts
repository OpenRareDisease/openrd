/*
 * Regression: before this filter existed, the migration runner
 * applied every `*.sql` in `db/migrations/`, including the
 * `*_down.sql` rollback scripts that live next to their forward
 * counterpart. Lexicographic order put each `NNN_*_down.sql` right
 * after its `NNN_*.sql` sibling, so the runner would:
 *
 *   1. apply 011_status_check_constraints.sql (creates CHECK
 *      constraints + patient_followup_events_same_profile trigger)
 *   2. apply 011_status_check_constraints_down.sql (DROPs every
 *      constraint + the trigger 011 just created — silent)
 *   3. apply 012_text_column_constraints.sql (creates 3 more CHECK)
 *   4. apply 012_text_column_constraints_down.sql (DROPs those too)
 *
 * Net result: prod boots, migrations "succeed", the ledger shows
 * 011/012 + their `_down` siblings applied, but the schema carries
 * none of the v2.4.0 data-hygiene guards. We only noticed locally
 * because step 3 of the pre-deploy validation queried
 * pg_constraint and got zero CHECK rows on patient_documents.
 *
 * These tests pin the contract: the runner MUST skip files whose
 * name ends in `_down.sql`, and MUST keep every forward-shaped
 * `*.sql`.
